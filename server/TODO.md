## Todo List

1. Need to implement MSW for mocking response from graphQL.
2. Need to better design(UX/UI) for websites.
3. Need to used debouncing while searching any product. I didn't implement because it's better to used while API search.
4. While npm test, there is a console error **console.error node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/virtual-console.js:29
   Error: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:80**
5. I think above error is because of Proxy settings, I need to do relevant change in your Proxy settings to reflect that. I need to look into that
